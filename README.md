# TzSoundBoard

This is TaggedZi's Sound Board. 

The goal of this project is to form a simple, easy to use, customizable sound board. After looking around I found very few open source versions that worked much less performed what I wanted.  So, I'm making my own.

As of the typing of this readme, it is "functional" however it is not polished, or ready for wide spread usage.  It still needs a lot of features and refinement. This is a spare time project for me, so I work on it when I have time.

Enjoy, Use, Contribute!
