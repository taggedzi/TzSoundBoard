If you want to contribute to the project, feel free, however I do expect githubs community standards to be followed.  As no one has been beating down the door to work on this, I don't expect anyone to actually read this.

As far as coding standards, I strive to follow Python's Pep8 standard of coding. And shortly I will implement unit testing.  I expect at least 80% code coverage on file added.  And NOT just tests to create coverage, but tests that are well written and actually test things.

That's all for now.
